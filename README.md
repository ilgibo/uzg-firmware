## KEY FIRMWARE FEATURES
- Change Ethernet/USB adapter mode through firmware or by physical button short press (Red LED On = USB mode, RED LED Off = Ethernet mode);
- Adapter mode selector through web-interface: `Zigbee-to-Ethernet`, `Zigbee-to-USB` and `Zigbee-to-WiFI`;
- Support mDNS autodiscovery in your network (go in the browser to `uzg-01.local`), in Zigbee2MQTT (set `port: mdns://uzg-01`), and in ZHA;
- Secure login through username and password;
- Zigbee2MQTT and ZHA config helper;
- Control behavior of LED (you can disable Mode LED, Power LED through firmware, or toggle both by the button long press);
- DHCP or static IP address for Ethernet connection;
- ESP32 (peripheral) and CC2652P (Zigbee) OTA updates, ESP32  and CC2652P restart;
- Switch CC2652P (Zigbee) to flash mode;
- Pairing mode for the adapter in router mode;
- Filter IP addresses for incoming connections to secure your network;
- Fully responsive web interface based on the latest Bootstrap 5.3.
- WireGuard VPN
- MQTT client for gateway monitoring and control
